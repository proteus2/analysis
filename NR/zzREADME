odeint :

  The last argument of the subroutine odeint in the calling program can
  be one of rkqs, bsstep, stiff, and stifbs (see NR chap.16).
  Note that there are two files which contain "bsstep".

bsstep.f90 vs bsstep_2nd.f90 :

  The subroutine bsstep is contained in the both, and the latter file
  can be used instead of bsstep.f90 when the problem is 2nd-order 
  differential equation set.
