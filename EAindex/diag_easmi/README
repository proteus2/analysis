This program downloads a part of the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis
for Research and Applications (MERRA) data that is provided by National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and calculates the East 
Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI) defined by Wang and Fan (1999, BAMS) 
and Wang et al. (2008, JCL). As a result, time-series of the EASMI is 
plotted during the specified period as well as the climatology and the 
anomaly of low-level wind.
To do this, type 'run_easmi' after specifying parameters for the 
plotting period by editting 'run_easmi'.
Users can refer to the files in the directory 'sample' for preview of 
the output of this program.
