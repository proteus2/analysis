This program downloads a part of the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis
for Research and Applications (MERRA) data that is provided by National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and calculates the East 
Asian Winter Monsoon Index (EAWMI) defined by Jhun and Lee (2004, JCL).
As a result, time-series of the EAWMI is plotted during the specified 
period as well as the climatology and the anomaly of upper-level wind.
To do this, type 'run_eawmi' after specifying parameters for the 
plotting period by editting 'run_eawmi'.
Users can refer to the files in the directory 'sample' for preview of 
the output of this program.
