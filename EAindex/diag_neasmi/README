------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program downloads the CPC (Climate Prediction Center) Merged 
Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) data, and calculates the Northeast 
Asian Summer Monsoon Index (NEASMI) defined by Lee et al. (2005, JCL).
As a result, time-series of the NEASMI is plotted during the specified 
period as well as the climatology and the regressed pattern of the 
precipitation.
To do this, type 'run_neasmi' after specifying parameters for the 
plotting period by editting 'run_neasmi'.
Users can refer to the files in the directory 'sample' for preview of 
the output of this program.
