Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear least squares (unconstrained).
This is a translation of the MINPACK routines, LMDER & LMDIF.
Use LMDER for functions which can be differentiated, and
LMDIF when it is necessary to use differences.
The ZIPped file (lm.zip) includes the MINPACK test programs, and
a simple example fitting a 4-parameter logistic.
